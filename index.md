Hello! My name is Abir Rahaman and I enjoy working with technology. My interest in programming began in 2018 when I took AP Computer Science in highschool. Fast forward to today and I am currently a senior at Virginia Tech pursuing my bachelors in computer science. I began my degree at Northern Virginia Community College and completed my associates in computer science there before transferring to Virginia Tech in the fall of 2021. With my first year at Virginia Tech now completed I am confident that I made the right choice in transferring here and am exicted to continue my degree.

I am on track to graduate in May 2023 and am now begninning to seek full time work opportunities for when that time comes. I am looking primarily to work as a Full Stack Developer.
