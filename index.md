Hello! My name is Abir Rahaman and I enjoy working with technology. My interest in programming began in 2018 when I took AP Computer Science in highschool. Fast forward to today and I am currently a junior at Virginia Tech pursuing my bachelors in computer science. I began my degree at Northern Virginia Community College and completed my associates in computer science there before transferring to Virginia Tech this fall. With my first semester at Virginia Tech now completed I am confident that I made the right choice in transferring here and am exicted to continue my degree.

Currently I am seeking a position as a Computer Science Intern for the upcoming summer 2022. I am open to pretty much anything and am eager for any opportunity that is offered.
